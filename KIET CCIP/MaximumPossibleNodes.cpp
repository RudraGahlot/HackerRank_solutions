//question//

A tree is called as a acyclic graph means a graph with no cycle. In general height of tree is denoted by H. A binary tree with N nodes can have maximum of (pow(2,H) – 1) nodes in a tree. Binary tree is a tree in which a node can have maximum of two childrens. Similarly we can make verious trees such that a node can have 1,2,3,4,..... any number of children. Assume that root is present at height 0.

Fing the maximum number of nodes possible in a ‘n-ary’ tree with height H.

Hint : Binary means 2-ary, ternary means 3-ary and so on.

Input Format

Input contains two integers n & H respectively.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 6

1 <= H <= 10

Output Format

Print the number of nodes.
